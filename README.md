# 2D-Unity-Platformer-Demo
Early Unity project where I experimented in learning the fundementals of creating a 2D platformer. I had created multiple levels and applied various concepts I had learnt through self study watching videos, using assets made available by users online. 

It marked one of my first projects working in Unity after primarily focusing on creating fun games on scratch, This was made in about 2 weeks focusing on trying to understand every action and what makes a "game"
